        MY LEARNING JOURNEY IN STS
      </p>

      <p class="Description-2">
        My experience in the subject Science, Technology, and Society has not been easy—something that is completely normal for any college student, as no subject comes without challenges. On the first day of class, when Professor Belmi asked us to introduce ourselves, including our Grade 12 GWA, I could not deny that I felt nervous. I also felt pressure because my blockmates were all intelligent and highly capable. However, despite those initial fears, my blockmates never made me feel left out. Their support eased the difficulties I was experiencing. I always had someone to ask whenever I did not understand a lesson, someone willing to help me correct my mistakes, and people who would study with me. For that, I am truly grateful to have them as my blockmates.
        Professor Belmi taught us not only the concepts of the subject but also the importance and relevance of Science, Technology, and Society in our lives. This made the course more meaningful and engaging for me. Even though it was challenging, it gave me a reason to expand my understanding of technology—from the prehistoric era up to the present—how it evolved, and how it shaped the lives and cultures of different societies across time.
        I became especially interested in our lessons on AI and robotics because these topics are very relevant today. Students use these technologies more than ever, and their advancements allow us to predict the possible future of our world. During our final exam, we were shown a scenario of what could happen if we allow AI and robots to dominate our lives and our way of thinking. This helped me realize that human abilities and human intelligence remain far more essential, because our decisions and actions are guided not only by logic but also by emotional intelligence, something technology cannot truly replicate.
        In our Capstone project, we also faced the challenge of creating an original product—one that has not yet been invented but could benefit society. It was difficult, but through teamwork and by applying our own knowledge, we were able to accomplish it.
        All of these experiences happened within just three months of Term 1. The journey was not easy—it felt like a roller coaster of challenges and learning—but in the end, it was truly worth it.
